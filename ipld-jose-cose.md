# IPLD Object Signing and Encryption

Ceramic will use JOSE and/or COSE as a standard way of signing ipld objects. There is a discussion going on [here](https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/251). Note that this work is still very much a work in progress. The proof of concept of Ceramic uses plain JWTs for signatures right now.
